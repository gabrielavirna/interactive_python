Linear data structures.
=======================
- Stacks, queues, deques, and lists are data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they're added/removed.
Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it.

Linear structures have 2 ends: the “left” & the “right”, the “front” & the “rear” , or the “top” & the “bottom.”
What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the
location where these additions and removals occur.
E.g. a structure might allow new items to be added at only one end, others allow items to be removed from either end.
