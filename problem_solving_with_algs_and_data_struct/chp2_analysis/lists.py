Lists
=====

Operations
-> indexing and assigning to an index position.
Both operations take the same amount of time no matter how large the list becomes.
When an operation like this is independent of the size of the list they are: O(1).

-> growing a list using: the append method or the concatenation operator.
The append method: O(1). The concatenation operator: O(k), where k is the size of the list that is being concatenated.

E.g. Generate a list of n numbers starting with 0 -> 4 ways -> see implementations os generate_list() below.

Big-O Efficiency
================

Operation	Big-O Efficiency
index []	        O(1)
index assignment	O(1)
append	            O(1)
pop()	            O(1)
pop(i)	            O(n)
insert(i,item)	    O(n)
del operator	    O(n)
iteration	        O(n)
contains (in)	    O(n)
get slice [x:y]	    O(k)
del slice	        O(n)
set slice	        O(n+k)
reverse         	O(n)
concatenate	        O(k)
sort	            O(n log n)
multiply	        O(nk)


Note:
When pop is called on the end of the list it takes O(1), but when pop is called on the first element in the list or
anywhere in the middle it is O(n) => The reason: When an item is taken from the front of the list, in Pythonâ€™s
implementation, all the other elements in the list are shifted one position closer to the beginning.

e.g. Measure the difference between the two uses of pop - see popzero, popend
